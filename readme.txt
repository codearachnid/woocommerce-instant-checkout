Sell your product with buy now option to go directly to checkout without going the cart pages

== Description ==
SELL ANYTHING.  
BEAUTIFULLY.  
**Instantly!**

Enable instant checkout from any or all of your product pages. Give your users instant gratification with a purchase. In the event the checkout does not complete, the product and all attributes are saved into the cart for later.

As a store adminstrator you will have granular control over the actions that instant checkout provides. Set a product to go directly to checkout without hitting the cart, via redirect or modal when the \"Buy Now\" button is clicked. In your store settings, you can control the visual layout of the checkout module and product button as well as allow a visitor to select either add to cart or instant checkout options.

### Please note: 
Due to the inherent security risk of finacial data given during checkout, the plugin will default to redirecting the user to the SSL version of the product page. This will ensure the checkout takes place within a secure session. This can be overriden in the case you are using a third party checkout mechanism like [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout).

== Installation ==
Installing the plugin is easy. Just follow these steps:

1. From the dashboard of your site, navigate to Plugins --> Add New.
2. Select the Upload option and hit \"Choose File.\"
3. When the popup appears select the woocommerce-instant-checkout-x.x.x.zip file from your desktop. (The \'x.x.x\' will change depending on the current version number).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it\'s finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful.
6. Then navigate to the form settings screen you wish to force SSL.
